Hi there,

So I've downloaded the latest instalment of the 360 controller driver (as released 13th May).

Upon connecting my Xbox 360 controller to my Mac (High Sierra, 10.13.6) via the USB (it is a standard xbox 360 controller, black, with wireless capability but I have connected it to my MAC using the USB cable that allows players to charge their controller via the xbox whilst playing. This cable also supports data feedback of control input, not just power, as I used to play using this cable while I had no battery to put in the controller to begin with). I then go to system preferences, click on xbox 360 controllers at the bottom.

On the page that then comes up it doesn't display my controller. It continues to say "no devices found"

I have already checked the box "Enable Driver" in the advanced section

and of course I enabled installation of it all to begin with by accessing 'security and privacy' and allowing for it to take place.



Any help?

Thanks,

P
